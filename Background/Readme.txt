Background material, including but not limited to the RNN-VAE system.

The RNN-VAE system was developed just before a class paper presentation, and I ended up presenting it along with some inspirations.

Includes both a (basic) writeup that contains a few more details of the process and development, and a presentation that gives several papers that acted as inspirations (including a few that didn't make it into RNN-VAE), as well as the RNN-VAE results
